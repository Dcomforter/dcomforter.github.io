# Portfolio Page - README.md

## Overview

Welcome to my portfolio! This is a showcase of my skills, projects, and professional experience as a DevOps Engineer and Software Test Engineer. This page highlights some of the work Iâ€™ve done in cloud infrastructure, automation, CI/CD pipelines, software development, and testing. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions or opportunities!



This is my first time building a portfolio and personal page, where I introduced myself, 
talked about my career journey so far and presented some of my uploaded projects.
