									<h1>A Little Story<br />
									About me</h1>
									<p>I am deeply passionate about the pursuit of knowledge 
										and have an unwavering drive to learn new things, even 
										if it means teaching myself from scratch.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/post2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Allow me to introduce myself – I'm Israel Okuneye, originally from vibrant Lagos, Nigeria, 
									and now embracing life in the United States for the past six years. My passion for learning 
									and pursuit of excellence drove me to seek higher education in this land of opportunities.</p>
								<p> In my free time, I cherish driving around, immersing myself in the breathtaking nature around me. 
									I find solace in taking serene walks at sunset, indulging in books and podcasts, and expressing my 
									love for music by playing in the worship band at my church and performing gigs with various bands. 
									Engaging in meaningful conversations with friends and family brings me immense joy.</p>
								<p> My insatiable thirst for knowledge and drive to master new skills led me to self-teach and embark 
									on exciting explorations in various domains. I believe that life's journey is a constant learning 
									experience, and I am committed to pushing my boundaries and achieving excellence.</p>
								<p> Graduating with Highest Honors in Computer Science from Iowa Western Community College and recently
									 earning my Bachelor's degree Cum Laude from Mississippi State University, I am equipped with a strong
									  foundation in this dynamic field. This educational journey has paved the way for turning my dreams 
									  into reality.</p>
								<p> Dedicated, consistent, and hardworking, I always strive to put my best foot forward. My positive 
									outlook on life, coupled with values like patience, reliability, and accountability, make me a 
									wonderful colleague. My collaborative, creative, and strategic strengths enable me to be a valuable 
									addition to any team.</p>
								<p> As I embark on my career, my goal is to find an organization whose values align with mine – a 
									place where my passion, ambition, and skills can flourish. My desire is to make a meaningful 
									impact on the world, contributing to positive change and making a difference in the lives of others.</p>
								<p> Thank you for considering my journey and aspirations. I am excited about the possibilities 
									ahead and eager to embrace new challenges with enthusiasm and determination. Together, let's 
									create a brighter future and drive success towards a shared vision.</p>
